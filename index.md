**Empowering homeowners with open-source tools to lower energy costs, reduce carbon emissions, and earn revenue by supporting the electric grid.**

A collaborative space for developing and discussing the software that turns our homes into smart energy hubs. We believe that by intelligently managing consumption, storage, and generation, homeowners can move from being passive consumers to active participants in the energy market.

Our focus is on creating a "Private Power Plant" (PPP) out of our collective residential assets. We do this by:

* **Smart Load Shifting:** Automatically running appliances and charging EVs when electricity is cheapest and greenest.
* **Optimizing Energy Storage:** Using home batteries and EV batteries to store excess solar or cheap grid energy.
* **Profitable Grid Participation:** Selling stored energy back to the grid during peak demand when prices are high, creating a profit for the homeowner and providing stability for the grid.

We actively work with and discuss tools and platforms including :
* **EMHASS:** An Energy Management for Home Assistant.
* **Amber Electric:** A provider that exposes real-time wholesale energy prices.
* **OCPP:** Open Charge Point Protocol for smart EV charging.
* And other solutions for interacting with solar inverters, home batteries, and smart home platforms.
